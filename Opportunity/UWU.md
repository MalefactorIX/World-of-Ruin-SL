# The United Wings of Uranus

Originally based out of the Sol system and named after the one of the gods of the oceans, UWU was originally a interplanetary shipping company that operated at the edge of their star system. As interstellar trade expanded, they soon grew into a multi-system union and trade organization.

Currently, 5 members participate and form the governing body of UWU known as the Council.
- The first seat is held by UWU itself on behalf of the Sol system.
- The second seat is held by the Sovereign Legion who occupies territory across roughly 16 stars.
- The third seat is held by the Empire of Spectra who currently claims territory across 2 stars.
- The fourth seat is held by the New Weave Alliance who currently claims 1 star.
- The final seat is held by Astral Corp who acts as a representative for 3rd party trade organizations.

UWU has existed for roughly 500 years and is managed by many varying races and automata. While they have sworn to never directly involve themselves in any armed conflict or claim of territory, it's individual members have been free to act independently in regards to such matters. While UWU itself has never directly confronted any other organization or empire, the second seat has on numerous occasions engaged in warfare against hostile powers - including the Empire of Tanta'knoll. This association with UWU has been a constant source of strain in business with them as a result.
