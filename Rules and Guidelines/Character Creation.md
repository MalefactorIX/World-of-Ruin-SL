### Note
This documentation refers to functions that will be available in the WOR 2.0 HUD. Not all features listed here may be available until this release is public.

# Appearance
- Humanoid, furry, and robotic avatars are allowed.  
- Avatars must be bipedal and adhere as closely as possible to the avatar skeleton. No ferals, giant, or chibi avatars without GM approval.
- You must wear an attire considered in-theme for your chosen faction. Some exceptions may be approved by a GM.
- Uniform or armor modifications must be approved by faction command where applicable.
- You may only have 1 character per faction and a total of 4 characters. An existing character may not change factions if another character is apart of it.

### Explicit Attachments
- Please try to include a modesty layer or toggle for your character where possible, especially if your character leans more into the [oversized category](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxLJZKImxA4k8GpOwBDX95uWWkYKWdoZKN?si=R6IxSQRgbvMCpXu0).
- Do not go out of your way to make your character [as digusting as possible](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxigcWgjAVFgGpnb75dI_UjC7uVqsIUJC1?si=KMUQaaH8Bo8Ob4NJ) even if they're Corrupted.

# HUD Setup
1. Click the HEART icon on your hud and select "Character" from the dialog menu.
2. Click "New". You will then be prompted to enter a "Name" and "Faction".
3. After confirming the name and faction are correct, hit "Save".
4. To load up the character, repeated Step 1 and select "Load".
5. You can now access the character from the load menu.

## Conversion
There is a 50% chance on death for you to build 1 stack of corruption, 10% if you have more than 999. Corruption decays by 50 per day while below 500 and you become fully corrupted at 1000. Above 500, specific facilities are required to reduce it. Specific events or triggers can inflict large amounts of corruption outside of this. Corruption is tracked per character and will be visible in your character sheet on your hud. Keep in mind that setting your character to the Corrupted faction will start you off at 1000 Corruption.

Keep in mind that Corruption WILL be visible under certain conditions and players wanting to be sneaky about it will need to exercise extreme caution to avoid revealing their taint. At specific thresholds, you'll gain "symptoms" that may need to be reflected in the appearance of your character. These are random but do not change once recieved. You can receive up to 3 before becoming fully corrupted. These will appear in your character sheet.

Once corruption reaches 1000, you cannot recover from it any more and your faction will automatically change to Corrupted. Your original faction will be noted however following this change.

# Faction-Specific Uniform Guidelines
### Empire of Tanta'knoll
- A uniform is provided for characters where needed.
- You may modify or recreate this uniform as long as it closely resembles the design or color scheme.
- Core components of the uniform consist of a Chest Guard (1 Piece), Thigh Guards (2 Pieces), Waist Guard (1 Piece), and Arm Guards (2 Pieces).
- Faction leaders may not change the overall design but have full reign over insignias and designations.

### Libra
- No specific uniform is provided or required at this time.
- Faction leaders may impose different guidelines regarding the appearance of their members. They also have full reign over insignias and designations.

### Opportunity, United Wings of Uranus
- No specific uniform is required or provided.
- Individual participants have full reign over the design of their attire as long as it matches their respective themes.

### Corrupted
- Native Corrupted are generally nude or wearing ragged attire.
- The Converted, those who become twisted by Corruption, usually wear a deteriorated version of their original faction's attire.
- Attires which are more dignified, refined, or 'clean' are generally considered out-of-theme for this faction [unless there is good reason for it](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxl8w0Gy5FEIYGNBNnSOUFI1YobJWer4HL?si=zk2ekWspTQmwqU9P).
- While not a hard requirement, many Corrupted characters, especially native ones, are very beastly or feral in appearance. Long spikes, sharp hair, razor-like teeth and claws, etc.

### Robots/Cyborgs/Androids
- Robotic characters, best described as your usual blocky hunks of steel and wire, are not required to wear specific attire. However, they must match their faction's colors where relevant.
- Androids/Cyborgs which otherwise heavily resemble normal characters will need to adhere to what attire is reasonably applicable.
