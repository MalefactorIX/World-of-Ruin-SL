# [Characters]

It is recommended you save any completed attire /without/ huds and weapons included as updates may render those items unusable.

### Appearance and Complexity
- Humanoid, furry, and robotic avatars are allowed.  
- Avatars must be bipedal and adhere as closely as possible to the avatar skeleton. No ferals, giant, or chibi avatars without GM approval.
- You must wear an attire considered in-theme for your chosen faction. Some exceptions may be approved by a GM.
- Uniform or armor modifications must be approved by faction command where applicable. 
- Avoid using extremely complex bodies, attachments, etc in your attire as they will cause performance issues for yourself and others. Keep complexity under 250,000 whenever possible, but less than 100,000 is recommended.
- Avatars should avoid exceeding 40 active scripts and script time should be under 0.3ms while idle. This includes all worn gear. The lower you can get these, the better for you and your fellow participants.

### Character Death
There are 2 death states: Downed and Dead.

1. Downed. This is when your HP hits 0. You are technically death or fatally wounded in this state, however you are still subject to the effects of "Tainted Men". In this state, you can respawn at any time or which struck by a "finisher". Do take into account relevant conduct rules in regards to respawning before doing so. A GM or session host will clarify any respawn guidelines if they deviate from what is mentioned here. 
2. Dead. This is a true death. This can only be authorized by a GM or the player. If your character is killed, you will be able to make a new one to replace them. When you die, all gear and resources are transferable to the new character. However, any faction-specific levels are reset and the spent EXP will be added back to your total EXP pool.

# [Conduct]

### Do the following:

- Adhere to all policies both in and outside of combat.
- If you're not in a protected scene or session, be prepared for a fight. Any hostile faction can walk up and declare battle, and you do not want to be caught unprepared. The same goes for objectives that may be in the area.
- Hold yourself to a high standard. Be the person you want others to be and don't lower yourself to their level.
- Always be respectful of others. We're all here to have fun.
- Always follow the instructions of the GM or Session Host. If you have an issue with their instructions or methods, file an incident report after the fact.
- You have the power to mute/block people who want to try harassing you in chat or IMs. It is strongly advised you use this for people who are being unreasonable, exceedingly toxic, or [this.](https://youtu.be/BDNdz3CMGdY?si=dvcscxodUbIMpY4V)
- Report any issues, concerns, etc to a faction leader, a moderation, or a GM. 

### Don't do the following:

- Griefing is any shape or form will not be tolerated. This includes taking unsanctioned action which may result in the following:
    1. The inability for people to use a region for its intended purpose
    2. The disruption or cease of function for any client, region, or service.
    3. Extreme, repetitive, and destructive behavior, remarks, or conduct, including harassment of any type.
- Complain in a unprofessional manner. Formal complaints should be filed via notecard
or discussed directly with an moderator or GM. Do not complain directly to region management regarding 
combat or roleplay issues, and please avoid bringing outside drama into group discussions.
- Start or engage in shouting matches with any participants. We're here to shoot people, play roles, [engage in the goof](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxGowV-8MpJsv8M4SBOPNMjbTk82jJWf2?si=HLdwXnAz8bVg1zQM), and have fun.
- Rule-lawyer or act in place of moderation. If another player is noncompliant, contact a GM or designated moderation for assistance. Do not get into arguments over guidelines.

### Explicit Content:

- All explicit interactions requires consent from all parties, even if the interaction itself does not imply consent (ie. rape scenes).
- Exceptionally brutal, violent, or gross scenes are not allowed and should be kept in DMs between consenting parties.
- Interactions which violate SL's TOS is not allowed in any form (ie. ageplay).

### [Rules of Engagement]

- If combat is not already taking place, hostility must be declared by using the character's "battle cry".
    Violation of this guideline is considered "RDM". Do not ambush people who aren't already engaging in combat.
- You may engage any combat-capable NPC without formal declaration, but upon doing so, you will be considered in combat and subject to immediate response.
- You may engage on sight any other opposing faction if they are already engaged in combat.
    Stratum: Hostile to all exception members of the Empire.
    Corrupted: Hostile to all but pack-members.
    Scavengers: Generally not hostile unless engaged or threatened.
    Usurpers: Hostile towards the Empire and Stratum.
- You may only use equipment authorized for use with WOR unless otherwise approved by a GM.
- Combat ceases when all hostile targets are Downed, or until a predetermined limit is reached.

# [Do not do]
- Do not take off your WOR hud while downed or respawn while another player is doing their "finisher". Certain rewards and interactions are tied to post-death roleplay, and doing so to manipulate or deny this will be considered a cheating offense.
- Players killed within 40m of their respawn location will not grant rewards. Avoid spawn-killing or camping respawn zones.
