# General
### Killing and Death
By default, the region will do nothing when you die and respawning is controlled by the meter if it is worn. This means that LLCS combat is opt-in through the use of the meter. If you do not wish to do combat, simply remove the meter. When you are KO'd by LLCS damage, you will immediately respawn similar to how standard LLCS combat works.

Depending on region settings, the meter will automatically disable LLCS support. This will take place if the region's death action is not set to do nothing, if damage adjustment is disabled, or if damage as a whole is disabled. If this is the case, assume LLCS will function as default.

Note that player kills from LLCS do not grant any experience. NPCs do not support LLCS or collision damage, but do support LBA as long as your meter is worn. NPCs will not damage you if you do not have a meter.

### Region-Specific Advisory
The WOR region imposes the following restrictions on LLCS damage. Keep in mind, any attempts to intentionally bypass these restrictions will be considered cheating and weapons which do so without due reason will be banned from use:
- Damage is capped at 100. It is not affected by offense or defenses stats.
- There is a 0.15s invulnerability window once the capped is reached or the target dies.
- The region will do nothing if you die.
- Damage adjustment is allowed but has no effect on how the meter handles damage as the meter itself only factors in the original damage recieved and will reduce all incoming LLCS damage to 0.

### Movement-assists
Movement assists are not allowed. This excludes those provided directly to players or those which mimic those items, ie. if your melee weapon has a lunge with a reasonable cooldown it will be allowed.

Avatar flight is permitted where relevant to the character. Anything which emulates or applies additional assistance to the default linden flight is not allowed. You must use the "Fly" feature on your client. Do bare in mind that WOR weapons deal 50% more damage while you are flying.

# Weapons
### Firearms
- Due to the 0.15s window, it is recommended to avoid weapons which fire faster than 600 RPM unless those weapons deal less than 100 damage per hit.
- Raycast/Hitscan weapons are restricted 600 RPM and a 50 LLCS damage cap per hit. Weapons which are 120 RPM or less may deal 100 damage per hit instead and must have a capacity no higher than 15+1 rounds.
- Non-AOE, Projectile weapons are limited to 100 rounds.

### Explosives
- Within 5m, may deal 100 damage. From 6m onward, damage must not exceed 50 LLCS.
- Area-of-effect weaponry may not tether their effects to players beyond their effective radius, ie. Damage over Time, flashbangs, slowing effects, etc.
- Crowd-control munitions may not disable or fully restrict control of an avatar or their attachments, ie. cagers, freezing effects, etc.
