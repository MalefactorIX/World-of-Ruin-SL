### Arcana: A summary
Many instutitions have tried to form a consensus on matters of the unknown. Among the most popular of theories is that of some divine or multiple deities, or the old tried and tested "it's magic, so we don't have to explain shit". For those who prefer to have an actual understanding of what we're dealing with, we refer to these matters as Arcana.

'Arcana' is thus used as a catch-all term to explain feats or events which have no other explanation. Things which should be impossible, but have yet transpired all the same. However, not all Arcana is the same. Arcana manifests in 2 particular forms: Corporeal Arcana which largely adheres the laws of the universe; and Non-corporeal Arcana, 'Aetherial' Arcana, or simply "Aether" - while rare - is as unpredictable as it is powerful.

Most Arcana follows some sort of convention or requirement that binds it to the rules of the universe. Many forms of evocation, summoning, conjuration, etc all have a specific set of rules which adheres to the principles of thermal dynamics and the conservation of energy. Even if we don't understand the mechanisms behind them, many of these common magics follow a simple give-and-take principle. We thus refer to these as Corporeal Arcana.

Aether, as previously mentioned, is unpredictable and often very deadly. Few can state they have been witness to such Arcana, and few among those live to tell the tale. The most recently observed event was that of the Fracture. The event itself remains beyond all explanation, and yet the effects have not subsided with the planet's destruction. We're still arguing over whether or not Arcana is even at play anymore or if the planet itself has become an endless beacon of Aether.

No particular form of standard Arcana is expressly frowned upon or forbidden. However, the use or manipulation of Aether is often strictly forbidden due to the aforementioned problems with it.
