## [Strats]
Currency traded within UWU trade network. They act as both proof of services rendered and a means of transferring goods. It is a purely digital currency with no physical form. Backed by the deeds of those who earned it.

## [Metal Scrap]
Assorted metal fragments of varying sizes and shapes. Used pretty much everywhere. Very common.
Despite how abundant scrap is, it is widely used in every industry which always has a demand for more.

## [Wood]
Comes in varying sizes and shapes. Most often used in production of organic materials and food. Renewable.
It has little value as it can be easily grown even in the most inhospitable of planetary surfaces. Life finds a way.

## [C-017]
A flammable compound widely used in fueling and combustion. Sometimes used as a lubricant for heavy machinery.
While not uncommon, its frequency of use makes it a highly prized commodity.

## [Magicryst (MCs)]
An assortment of gems and minerals able to channel mystical energies. Highly sought after, very valuable.
Sometimes confused for Aether-Crystals (ACs). It is important to remember that Magicrysts absorb aether, but do not naturally produce it.

## [Nutrients]
Proteins, minerals, and compounds that can be metabolized by organic beings. Used for making food and medical supplies.
Once had value, but was later made valueless after several sources were linked to bloodbanks and organ harvesting. Funnily enough, selling raw Nutrients was made a warcrime by the Empire as a result. Though this is rarely enforced.

## [Water (H2O)]
This miracle compound comes in multiple forms and exists across all known states of matter. Used for nearly everything.
Has no value as an imp with a wood rod and a dream can easily find a source.

## [Concentrated Aether Crystals (CACs)]
Often confused for Magicrysts, however it is important to remember that Magicrysts absorb aether while Aether-Crystals produce it. As such, these are used as large-scale reactor cores and energy production, and are also known for being forged into world-shattering detonation modules. The Empire has found a way to condense these into a more manageable size without reducing their efficiency.
Unlike natural Aether-Crystals though, these are far more volatile outside of storage and as such the condensation process is reversed before they are utilized in any manner. The need to do so makes them less valuable than raw Aether-Crystals, but still very expensive.

## [Densite Blocks]
A hyper-dense material that rivals the material of some neutron stars. It possesses a high energy capacity allowing it to absorb everything from background radiation to high-frequency energy weapons. Most commonly used on fleet carrier vessels and combat ships when refined into Densite Alloy.
For ease of storage and transport, all Densite imports are cleaned and cut into blocks and later reforged to meet the required specifications for usage. The need to reforge them later reduces their value in comparison to raw Densite.
