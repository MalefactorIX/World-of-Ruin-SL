# The Void
Little is known about the Void. It is believed to be the space between spaces. A world that exists where worlds by their very nature should not. Where time itself becomes muted, the space itself is but vast nothingness.
The creatures which emerge from it are unlike anything we have observed in the vastness of our own galaxy. They wield power which violate all known physics, both material and immaterial. They take upon forms which
should not be able to sustain themselves, and yet serve as prime vessels for their destructive intentions. Attempts to converse and parley with them are futile. Either they do not care, or they do not understand. All we have seem them do is kill, destroy, and bring ruin to all that once stood before them.
We have largely considered the Void to be simply a space beyond our own, but many begin to fear whether or not these abominations are merely a product of the Void or a part of it.
